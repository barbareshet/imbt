Use with ACF repeater plugin for easier page editing. This plugin adds an accordion feature to the page edit view.

== Description ==

= What this plugin is: =
This plugin is designed for use with the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin - Repeater add on. Collapses all advanced custom field repeater rows by default and adds accordion functionality to them for easy editing. Only tested with repeater rows.

If you are using the repeater plugin add on you will probably notice that the paged view becomes quite cumbersome as you add more entires using the repeater fields. It becomes very difficult to drag fields up or down and the page becomes very long.

This plugin is the answer to make editing easier.
